-The program codes in this folder are to compute the maximum norm errors of AVF methods with different time steps, and record the corresponding running times.

_"reference.mat" is copied from the previous folder "1.compute_reference_solution". 

-Please run "main.m" directly, and it will return "data_AVF.mat", which contains
--ERR_AVF: the errors for each simulation;
--Err_Order_AVF: the convergence order of the method;
--ENERGY_ERR_AVF: the energy discrepancies for each simulation;
--TIME_AVF: the running times for each simulation.

-We also provide the data in the folder.
