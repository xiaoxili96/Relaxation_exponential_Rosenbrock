-The program codes in this folder are to compute the maximum norm errors of EAVF methods with different time steps, and record the corresponding running times.

_"reference.mat" is copied from the previous folder "1.compute_reference_solution". 

-Please run "main.m" directly, and it will return "data_EAVF.mat", which contains
--ERR_EAVF: the errors for each simulation;
--Err_Order_EAVF: the convergence order of the method;
--ENERGY_ERR_EAVF: the energy discrepancies for each simulation;
--TIME_EAVF: the running times for each simulation.

-We also provide the data in the folder.
